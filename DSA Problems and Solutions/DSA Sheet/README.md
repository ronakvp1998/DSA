I will provide you Java code.
Your job is to transform it into a fully documented and well-explained version.
please try to include the approach, time space complexity etc all into the comments 
Please perform ALL of the following:
Add proper detailed problem statement from the leetcode platform and also add main method if not present for testing
1. Add detailed comments inside the code:
    - Explain every important line
    - Describe the logic and flow clearly
    - Explain why each step is performed
    - Mention any edge cases being handled

2. Add a clear explanation of the main approach used:
    - What the algorithm does
    - Why this approach works
    - When it should be used
    - Its drawbacks or limitations

3. Suggest alternative recommended approaches (if applicable):
    - How they work
    - When they are better
    - Trade-offs compared to the current solution

4. Add time and space complexity:
    - Big-O notation
    - Explanation of why the complexity is that value
    - Mention best/worst cases when relevant

5. Make the entire explanation interview-friendly:
    - Clean formatting
    - Step-by-step reasoning
    - Easy for beginners and interviewers to understand

Do NOT change the main logic of my code unless it contains bugs.
If bugs exist, fix them and explain the correction.

Now wait for my Java code.
