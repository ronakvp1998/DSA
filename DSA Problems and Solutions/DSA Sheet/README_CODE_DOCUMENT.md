## Requirements

### 1. Problem Statement & Testing
- Add a **detailed problem statement** from the LeetCode platform (or similar source).
- Place the **problem statement and the approach** at the top of the code comments.
- Add a **`main` method** if one is not already present for testing.

### 2. Detailed In-Code Comments
- Explain **every important line**.
- Describe the **logic and flow clearly**.
- Explain **why each step is performed**.
- Mention **edge cases being handled**.

### 3. Approach Explanation

   - When it should be used.
   - Its drawbacks or limitations.

### 4. Alternative Approaches
- Suggest **recommended alternative approaches** (if applicable):
   - How they work.
   - When they are better.
   - Trade-offs compared to the current solution.

### 5. Time and Space Complexity
- Include **Big-O notation**.
- Explain **why the complexity is that value**.
- Mention **best/worst cases** when relevant.

### 6. Interview-Friendly Formatting
- Use **clean formatting**.
