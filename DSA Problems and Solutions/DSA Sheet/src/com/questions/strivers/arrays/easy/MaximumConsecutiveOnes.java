 Problem Statement:
 Given an array that contains only 1 and 0, return the count of the maximum consecutive ones in the array.

 Example 1:
 Input: arr = {1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1}
 Output: 3
 Explanation:
   - The first streak has 2 consecutive 1's.
   - The second streak has 3 consecutive 1's.
   - The maximum streak length is 3.

 Example 2:
 Input: arr = {1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1}
 Output: 2
 Explanation:
   - The longest streak of consecutive 1's is of length 2.
