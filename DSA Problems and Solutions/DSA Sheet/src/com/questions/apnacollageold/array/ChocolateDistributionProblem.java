// 5 Given an array arr[] of n integers where arr[i] represents the number of chocolates in ith packet. Each packet can have a variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:
//
//Each student gets exactly one packet.
//The difference between the maximum and minimum number of chocolates in the packets
// given to the students is minimized.
